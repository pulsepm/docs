# About Us

Welcome to our About Us page! We are a small but passionate team of developers dedicated to enhancing the multiplayer experience for the iconic game, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. 

## What We Do

We have developed a package manager for open.mp, a multiplayer modification for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Our package manager simplifies the installation and management of gamemods and libraries, including plugins as well, making it easier for coders to customize and improve their server experience.

### Key Features

- **Easy Installation**: Streamlined process for installing and updating librares.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and accessible for both beginners and experienced users.
- **Reliable Performance**: Designed to enhance stability and performance.

## Our Vision

Instead of using outdated libraries, why don't we update it with a single command? Instead of finding it and downloading obsolete files or corrupted include files from solidfiles, why don't we install it with a single command? We envision to ease the proccess of managing project dependencies with Pulse, as well as managing the server itself.
