# Commands

In a _CLI (Command Line Interface)_ command application, a **"command"** refers to a specific action or task that users can perform by typing instructions into the command line. Each command is associated with a particular functionality of the software and is typically invoked by typing its name followed by any required arguments or options. Commands, along with their syntax, arguments, and options, provide users with a means to interact with and control the software directly from the command line interface.

Pulse is a CLI itself so it has many commands which can help you build and maintain your **PAWN** code.

## Syntax

Each command may have require arguments in order to get executed properly as well as options. The latter ones are often marked
with **-** in shortened or **--** in longer forms. 

!!! note
    All commands have `--help` option!

Documentation we provied will follow one standardized pattern:

- Command name with its explanation paragraph.
- Syntax paragraph showing the proper usage.
- Example of command being executed within respective shell.
- Possible errors and exit codes or return values.
